# Cellular-Network-Provider-Growth-in-Indonesia

## Introduction
This project is a simple data visualization project for Cellular Growth in Indonesia from 2013-2016. This project uses R for it's programming language to visualize and organize the dataset.

The original source file provide us the data with the following structure:

No | Penyelenggara | Brand | Tahun 2013 | Tahun 2014 | Tahun 2015 | Tahun 2016 |
---|----------|-------|------------|------------|------------|------------|

We can simplify it in the prepared file  to this following structure:
No | Peneyelanggara | Brand | Tahun | Prabayar | Pascabayar | Jumlah |
---|----------|-------|-------|----------|------------|--------|

With this structure, we can easily filter which row will be needed for plot

## Subscriber Count
The first and the most general view that can be extracted by this data is the overall number of the subscriber for each provider by year.
